# Kali Linux live-build-config

[Official Documentation](http://docs.kali.org/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso)

This is the base branch of my configurations and as such, has no extra configuration

 

Some Debian bugs filed for issues encountered in Kali:

[684865]: live-build: lb_binary_syslinux fails to include flavour in menu entry

[684891]: live-build: add a config parameter to define the project name

[684893]: live-build: fails to find bootloaders files when running from git checkout

[684896]: live-build: loading of build.sh does not work as expected in various scripts
